Lab #8 Eliza â€“ Designing a Client-Server Application
Warmup - text responses

1. The 1st client connection is successful and 
	allows me to successfully send messages to 
	the server. The 2nd client successfully 
	connects, prompts for my messages, but 
	server appears to have failed in receiving them. 
	The 3rd, 4th, and 5th client connections 
	all time out.
2. Even though the 2nd client successfully connects, 
	its call appears to be blocked when it tries 
	sending a message to the server. We later learn that 
	it was not totally blocked because it is received by
	the server when the 1st client disconnects. However,
	if the 2nd client tries to sends any other messages 
	to the server (after its first message) before the 1st
	client disconnects, those calls will be blocked and they
	will never be received by the server. 
3. When I disconnect the 1st client, the
   message I attempted to send in the 2nd 
   client is received by the server. Also, 
   connection to a 3rd is now successful 
   (but it now acts like how the 2nd one 
   did before - prompting for my messages,
   which will not be received by the server
   until I disconnect the 2nd client).
