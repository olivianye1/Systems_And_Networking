Lab #9 
README file

Dear grader, 

I have included a text file called "sampleMsg.txt" in my submission. Please ensure
that you save this textFile in the same directory that you are running the client
and server in. This is where my client reads in the message from. If you would 
like to change the message you are testing with, feel free to change the contents 
of this file to any other series of binary numbers (can handle any message length
of 100 characters or less). 

Compile the program with the following two commands:
$gcc crcClient.c -o client
$gcc crcServer.c -o server

Run the program in two separate terminal windows, one with this command to start the server:
./server

Then the other with this command to start the client:
./client



Hope you are having a nice day and are staying healthy and safe! 
Best, 
Olivia
